===================================

Explanation: The ZeldaRecipeGUI prompts 
the user to select a recipe from the
combo box and then press a button to
display the recipe. The output to the
screen is an image of the recipe and
a list of the (up-to) five ingredients.

Disclaimer: Don't try these recipes at
home. They are purely for the game The
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
